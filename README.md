# ShortcutColorSwitcher

This is a simple web app that lets you assign custom key combinations to change colors on the page.

How it works:
Enter a key combo:

A single letter (e.g. A)

Or a combo like Ctrl+R, Shift+T, or Meta+K

Enter a number from 1 to 3:

1 = Change background color

2 = Change text color

3 = Change container colors

Type any valid color (name like red or hex like #ff0000)

Click Submit

Try pressing the key combo you entered â€” and watch the color change!
